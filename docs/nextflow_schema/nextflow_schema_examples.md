# Example Nextflow schema

You can see an example JSON Schema for a Nextflow pipeline `nextflow_schema.json` file below.

This file was generated from the nf-core pipeline template, using `nf-core create`.
It is used as a test fixture in the nf-validation package [here](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-validation/blob/master/plugins/nf-validation/src/testResources/nextflow_schema.json).

!!! note

    More examples can be found in the plugin [`testResources` directory](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-validation/blob/master/plugins/nf-validation/src/testResources/).

```json
