**A Nextflow plugin to work with validation of pipeline parameters and sample sheets.**

## Introduction

This [Nextflow plugin](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html#plugins) provides a number of functions that can be included into a Nextflow pipeline script to work with parameter and sample sheet schema. Using these functions you can:

- 📖 Print usage instructions to the terminal (for use with `--help`)
- ✍️ Print log output showing parameters with non-default values
- ✅ Validate supplied parameters against the pipeline schema
- 📋 Validate the contents of supplied sample sheet files
- 🛠️ Create a Nextflow channel with a parsed sample sheet

Supported sample sheet formats are CSV, TSV and YAML (simple).

## Quick Start

Declare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:

```groovy title="nextflow.config"
plugins {
  id 'nf-validation'
}
```

This is all that is needed - Nextflow will automatically fetch the plugin code at run time.

> [!NOTE]
> The snippet above will always try to install the latest version, good to make sure
> that the latest bug fixes are included! However, this can cause difficulties if running
> offline. You can pin a specific release using the syntax `nf-validation@0.3.2`

You can now include the plugin helper functions into your Nextflow pipeline:

```groovy title="main.nf"
include { validateParameters; paramsHelp; paramsSummaryLog; fromSamplesheet } from 'plugin/nf-validation'

// Print help message, supply typical command line usage for the pipeline
if (params.help) {
   log.info paramsHelp("nextflow run my_pipeline --input input_file.csv")
   exit 0
}

// Validate input parameters
validateParameters()

// Print summary of supplied parameters
log.info paramsSummaryLog(workflow)

// Create a new channel of metadata from a sample sheet
// NB: `input` corresponds to `params.input` and associated sample sheet schema
ch_input = Channel.fromSamplesheet("input")
```
